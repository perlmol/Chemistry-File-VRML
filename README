Chemistry::File::VRML version 0.10
==================================

This module generates a VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) representation
of a molecule, which can then be visualized with any VRML viewer. This is a
PerlMol file I/O plugin, and registers the 'vrml' format with
L<Chemistry::Mol>. Note however that this file plugin is write-only; there's no
way of reading a VRML file back into a molecule.

This module is a modification of PDB2VRML by Horst Vollhardt, adapted to the
L<Chemistry::File> interface.
